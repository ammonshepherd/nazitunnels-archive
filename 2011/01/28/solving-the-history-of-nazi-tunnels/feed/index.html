It was a show on Discovery, by Olly Steeds. I have not seen the &quot;Cities of the Underworld&quot; one, and maybe shouldn&#039;t. :) 

I have now realized that I will need to focus on just the projects at Porta Westfalica for the dissertation. Any help you can provide on locating documents and other sources is greatly appreciated. In my dissertation, I will try to show that this kind of collaboration (open access to information on a website) is a good and important step for &quot;doing&quot; history.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, I agree that sometimes entertainment overshadows the reality of life.  In fact, don&#039;t get me started on the &quot;reality&quot; shows that have become so popular.  Is life so boring, that we have to be entertained constantly?  Do we have to sensationalize things in order to put value on them?  

Maybe our values are being misplaced and should, instead, be properly placed back on the simple acts of kindness we see, the humble and needed service given freely to others and perpetuating loving relationships with our family and friends.]]></description>

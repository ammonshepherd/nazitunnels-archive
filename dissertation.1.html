      <h2>Abstract:</h2>
      <p>
      In 1944, Allied air forces dropped over 914,000 tons of bombs on Germany,
      almost 60% of the 1.588 million tons of bombs dropped on Germany during
      World War II. Allied air command intended these bombs for Germany&rsquo;s
      armaments factories, including aircraft manufacturing, and oil and fuel
      production. German military leaders sought desperately to keep armaments
      production up despite the storm of explosives thundering down on their
      factories and cities. The best laid plan of German military and Nazi
      leaders was to relocate key industrial facilities to underground,
      bomb-proof sites. One such site was a pair of abandoned sandstone
      quarries located in Porta Westfalica, near Hannover, Germany. Tank
      busting rockets and radar tubes were produced here, and a complete
      lubricating oil plant was weeks away from production before the war
      ended. To supplement the few German civilian miners and engineers who
      were not at the front lines, substitute labor came from the nearby
      Neuengamme concentration camp. Prisoners of war, political dissidents and
      Jews were forced to work and die under inhumane conditions to enlarge the
      quarries, reconstruct machinery and manufacture armaments for the Reich.
      This research presents the selection and creation of the underground
      factories at Porta Westfalica and stitches together an account of life
      for male and female prisoners through the use of survivor testimony and
      questionnaires filled out shortly after the war.

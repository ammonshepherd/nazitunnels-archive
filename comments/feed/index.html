I am no longer working on this.

Your best bet is to contact the KZ Gedenk- and Dokumentationsstaette Porta Westfalica.

I attended 8 th grade there but 9th grade was in Munich American HS were I lived in a dorm from Sunday night to Friday after class when a bus took us back home to Oberammergau for the weekend.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello,

I am a young history and geography teacher coming from the Alsace region, in France. I am working on a publication and also on a documentary about the town of Markirch during WWII. In spring 1944, a kommando from KL-Natzweiler worked in the tunnel with almost 2000 prisonners (Projekt A9). I found many interesting documents on your website, your work is really amazing too. The question is : do you have any other documents concerning the Markirch A9 projekt ? Do you have any advice about archives that could have this kind of informations ?

Thank you very much,

Best Regards,

Pierre.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just to ask if there is any data on a SS tunnela complex around Innsbruck Austria.
The Innsbruck type A bomb was supposed to be mounted there, about 1943.
Thanks]]></description>

I do not know how old this information is or if it is still being researched. I have actually been in the cave off of the NATO base in Oberammergau back in 1970 and have a small map if I can find it]]></description>

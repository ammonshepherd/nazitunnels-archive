					<description><![CDATA[In the late 70&#039;s I spent time in Massweiler Germany and was fascinated by the tunnels close to the village. A coupe of them still had images of swaztikas on the outside of the tunnals. Any information about this area would be appreciated. My brothers and I (now in our 50&#039;s) explored a few of them, but would love any updates in their conditions. Thank you.]]></description>

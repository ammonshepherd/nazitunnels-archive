Agnes,

I&#039;m so very glad to hear that the website helped you find information about your great grandfather! Such interactions truly made all of the work worth it.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there,

I just found your site through a Google search.  In your methodology presentation, you take Elie Barioz as an example.  He was my great grandfather, and until I found your site, I had no idea what had become of him, neither did any of my family members.

Thank you,]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://nazitunnels.org/about/#comment-370&quot;&gt;Steve Quinton&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Steve,

Thanks for leaving a note. I am definitely willing to share the information I have. That is one of the big parts of my dissertation research, is to see how opening up my materials benefits other researches and the interested public. I also did not come up with much information about the underground factories during my initial search, which is why I chose it for my dissertation project. My goal is to upload all of the documents that I find (copyright allowing) to this site so they are available to anyone. So check back often.

A good place to look for information is the Goudsmit Collection at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. The National Archives in College Park, MD also have micro film copies of many Nazi documents. They hold a bit of information, but it is kind of scattered. They have some decent finding tools here: http://www.archives.gov/research/captured-german-records/foreign-records-seized.html#virginia

I&#039;m hoping to get a scholarship or two to do some research in Germany next school year, so that I can search the archives in Germany, and document and locate as many of the tunnel sites as possible.

There are also a plethora of sites and other people looking into similar things. I&#039;ll have to add a page of resources soon...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I have looked at your site here and wondered if you could help me out.
I belong to an obscure group called MIAG (Military Industrial Archealogly Group)
Which is a small group who research mainly military sites. We are currantly looking at the CIOS reports on the underground factories that were built during WW2 and we are finding that some of the sites or any infor mation is hard to come by.
Would you consider sharing some of your findings/information?
kind regards

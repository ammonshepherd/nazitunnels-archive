Check for grammar, argument, etc.<br \/>\n  &#8211; Read Chapter 1, part 2 for flow, narrative, grammar, and to see if it fits<br \/>\n    the conclusion of that section.<br \/>\n  &#8211; Format and send it to committee.<\/p>\n<p>Need to research:<br \/>\n  &#8211; which historians argue that &#8220;Vernichtung durch Arbeit&#8221; was selectively<br \/>\n    applied, and which do not.<\/p>\n<h2>Wednesday, July 13, 2016<\/h2>\n<p>Maybe I should just roll Chapter 1, part 1 into part 2 and not have parts.<\/p>\n<p>To do today:<br \/>\n  &#8211; Read through Koel book on history of the SS.<br \/>\n  &#8211; Start reading Langerich&#8217;s biography of Himmler (decided to get the English<br \/>\n    version for the sake of time).<br \/>\n  &#8211; Read through Chapter 3 to see if my new argument is supported<br \/>\n    &#8211; Notes while reading:<br \/>\n      &#8211; Clarrify argument for the chapter and rewrite the chapter introduction.<br \/>\n      &#8211; Use available works about the Neuengamme KL when discussing the<br \/>\n        Neuengamme KL<br \/>\n      &#8211; Address the vast literature about the Holocaust and KL research.

Then in Word, search for <code>'.@'<\/code> and replace with<br \/>\n        <code>','<\/code>.<\/p>\n<h2>Thursday, July 14, 2016<\/h2>\n<p>Really frustrated and depressed about the dissertation today. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll<br \/>\nget it finished, and I don&#8217;t care to work on it anymore. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll get<br \/>\nthe argument right. I probably can&#8217;t justify\/support the argument based on the<br \/>\nresearch I have already done, and I can&#8217;t handle any more research at the<br \/>\nmoment. It&#8217;s never enough! (This song comes to mind: <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/37tzsSP-Dc0\" data-rel=\"lightbox-video-0\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/37tzsSP-Dc0<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>Well, suck it up, quit whining (elitist, 1st world problems) and get back to<br \/>\nreading through Chapter 3.<\/p>\n<p>Notes while reading:<br \/>\n  &#8211; At beginning of Prisoner Hierarchy section, discuss why important and what<br \/>\n    it shows about SS ideology vs. economic drive.<br \/>\n    &#8211; Do this for each section.<br \/>\n  &#8211; Prisoner Hierarchy section:<br \/>\n    &#8211; Make note that this camp used similar hierarchy as other camps. Self<br \/>\n      regulating inmates.<br \/>\n    &#8211; Section on hair: provide more analysis. What did the different hair cuts<br \/>\n      mean?<br \/>\n    &#8211; Letters and packages section: Show that Danish were privileged because<br \/>\n      they were the only ones allowed to send and receive letters and packages.<\/p>\n<h2>Friday, July 15, 2016<\/h2>\n<p>So, good news back from the committee which means I&#8217;m in good spirits again.<br \/>\nWhat I did was actually good and acceptable. So now, moving on. Some thoughts:<br \/>\n  &#8211; Perhaps just merge part 1 and part 2 of chapter 1.<br \/>\n  &#8211; Maybe leave Chapter 3 and 4 as is with a clarification or argument that the<br \/>\n    survivor voices should stand on their own. Then a fifth chapter analyzing<br \/>\n    them?<\/p>\n<p>To do today:<br \/>\n  &#8211; Read through Spoerer book, to say that I have and footnote it, shows basics<br \/>\n    of SS history. Found really good article by Spoerer with discussion about<br \/>\n    defining the terms forced laborer, foreign laborer, slave laborer, and<br \/>\n    less-than-slave laborer. Use this in Chapter 1 instead of the confusing<br \/>\n    paragraph I had before.<br \/>\n  &#8211; Merge part 1 and 2 in Chapter 1. (not done yet)<br \/>\n  &#8211; Write up this weeks notes as a blog post (done a few days later)<br \/>\n  &#8211; Format Chapter 1 and update the dissertation website (not done yet).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I recently had a whole week to work on my dissertation.

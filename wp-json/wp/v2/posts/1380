Set up was a bit more difficult than planned. I had an Exhibit working for a different project, and was finally able to massage the data into a copy of that code, and integrate it into the website using a WordPress Template.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1388\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1388\" style=\"width: 265px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/map\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1388\" title=\"Screen Shot 2012-12-06 at 6.15.20 PM\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.15.20-PM-265x300.png\" width=\"265\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.15.20-PM-265x300.png 265w, http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.15.20-PM-905x1024.png 905w, http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.15.20-PM-624x705.png 624w, http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.15.20-PM.png 1002w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1388\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Map showing the location of tunnel projects in the A and B groups.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>This allowed me to display the data in three different views. First is the map, as seen above. I was able to show the tunnels in the two different groups identified in the documents. The A projects were existing tunnels, caves, or mines that were to be retrofitted and improved before factories could be moved in. B projects were to be completely new underground spaces.<\/p>\n<p>The Exhibit also has a table view, showing all of the items with select information for easy comparison, or information retrieval at a glance. For each view, the right hand side provides options for filtering the data.

It would also have been neat to pull the information from the archive. Perhaps that can be built later.<\/p>\n<h3>Part 2<\/h3>\n<p>I also set up an Omeka install to host the images I had previously digitized from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. I not only want an archive, but also a way to have others transcribe and translate the documents, so I installed the Scripto plugin which is dependent on a MediaWiki install as well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/arhcive\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1384\" title=\"Screen Shot 2012-12-06 at 6.10.33 PM\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.10.33-PM-300x295.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"295\" srcset=\"http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.10.33-PM-300x295.png 300w, http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.10.33-PM-624x615.png 624w, http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.10.33-PM.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The ability to transcribe and translate is also an integral part of my dissertation. I want to argue, and show that historical work can not and should not be done alone. One way to do this is to get help from the undergraduates in the German Language program here at George Mason University. The German Language director at GMU is all on board to have some of her upper level students take on translation as part of their course work. This not only helps me, but helps them learn German by looking at interesting historical documents (and hopefully get them interested in history), but also helps future researches to be able to search and find documents easier.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1390\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1390\" style=\"width: 237px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/archive\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1390\" title=\"Screen Shot 2012-12-06 at 6.44.14 PM\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.44.14-PM-237x300.png\" width=\"237\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.44.14-PM-237x300.png 237w, http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.44.14-PM-811x1024.png 811w, http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.44.14-PM-624x787.png 624w, http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.44.14-PM.png 985w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1390\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Transcribing and translating made possible by Scripto and MediaWiki.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Historical Questions<\/h2>\n<p>This was the hardest part of the course. I&#8217;m really good at creating digital stuff because that is what I do all day. But I&#8217;m a little rusty on the historical interpretation and asking questions. What also makes this hard is not knowing completely what data I have yet.<\/p>\n<p>Part of the problem with coming up with good, probing questions, is that I haven&#8217;t had a lot of time to look at the documents to see what is there. Also, there is not much written on this topic, so I&#8217;m kind of figuring out the story as I go. It&#8217;s a lot easier to read secondary works and ask new questions, or ask old questions in different ways. But there are no questions yet, except what happened.<\/p>\n<p>The bigger questions, in light of this course, should be about how does this technology that we learned help understand the history, or help generate new questions. Will displaying the data in different ways help me make connections and inspire ideas that I would not otherwise have made or thought? Do the digital tools allow me to process more data than I could do non-digitally?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/archive\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1381\" title=\"Screen Shot 2012-12-06 at 6.11.19 PM\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.11.19-PM-300x282.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"282\" srcset=\"http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.11.19-PM-300x282.png 300w, http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.11.19-PM-624x587.png 624w, http:\/\/nazitunnels.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Screen-Shot-2012-12-06-at-6.11.19-PM.png 997w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Another stumbling block (or is it a building block, it&#8217;s all about perspective, right), comes from my recent trip to Germany for research. While there I met with Dr. Ulrich Herbert at the University of Freiburg. He&#8217;s somewhat of a scholar in the area of slave labor, and has kept up to date on the writings regarding the underground dispersal projects. His wise suggestion for my dissertation was to focus on a single tunnel site, rather than trying to write about the organization responsible for all of the dispersal projects. Such an undertaking would take a life time, he said. So now I need to focus on just one tunnel, rather than all of them. Fortunately, Dr. Herbert put me in contact with the Director of the <a title=\"Mittelbau-Dora Concentration Camp Memorial\" href=\"http:\/\/dora.de\">Mittelbau-Dora Concentration Camp Memorial<\/a>, Dr. Jens-Christian Wagner. With his help, I may be able to find a specific tunnel to focus on, and make my trip in July 2013 that much more profitable.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Part of my dissertation is to create an online archive of the documents I find.

Apparently at one time either the Danish government, the National Museum in Copenhagen, or the Freedom Museum in Copenhagen put out a survey to former concentration camp inmates.<\/p>\n<p>Axel Christian Hansen was one such inmate. Born in 1899, he was captured in Denmark as a political dissident on September 30, 1944. Sent first to Neuengamme, he was then sent to Porta Westfalica on October 3. His answers are terse, yet convey much; as do the questions left unanswered. Here are a few of the questions and his answers. The survey was conducted in Danish on an unspecified date, and translated into German in 1990.<\/p>\n<p>The first section deals with his transportation from Neuengamme (near Hamburg) to Porta Westfalica.<\/p>\n<p><em>Type of transportation:<\/em> Cattle car\/<del>\u00a0passenger car\/automobile\/ship<\/del> &#8211; <del>open<\/del>\/closed<\/p>\n<p><em>How many in each car:<\/em> 50 men<\/p>\n<p><em>Was there straw or carpet or other?<\/em> No<\/p>\n<p><em>Did you receive any rations during the trip? bread-jam-meat?<\/em> No<\/p>\n<p><em>How much?<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Did you receive anything to drink?<\/em> No<\/p>\n<p><em>How did you relieve yourself?<\/em> In the corner of the car.<\/p>\n<p><em>Were there air raids?<\/em> Yes<\/p>\n<p><em>Did you stay in the cattle car?<\/em> Yes<\/p>\n<p><em>Was it locked?<\/em> Yes<\/p>\n<p><em>Where were the guards?<\/em> In the first car.<\/p>\n<p><em>Where there any dead or wounded?<\/em> No<\/p>\n<p><em>Where there any escape attempts?<\/em> No<\/p>\n<p><em>Was there any mistreatment?<\/em> No<\/p>\n<p><em>Further comments regarding the transportation and description of exceptional experiences.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>There was no time to sleep in the train car because there were too many of us. When we were shipped to Porta, we were given a little bit of water and a little bit to eat from a guard.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The second part deals with the arrival in Porta Westfalica.<\/p>\n<p><em>What did you have remaining of your things upon arrival?<\/em> A belt.<\/p>\n<p><em>Was your face or head shaved?<\/em> Yes<\/p>\n<p><em>Was your body shaved?<\/em> Yes<\/p>\n<p><em>Where you shaved in another way?<\/em> Yes, with a reverse mowhawk<\/p>\n<p><em>How often did you get a reverse mowhawk (Autobahn)?<\/em> 3 times<\/p>\n<p><em>When were you allowed to grow your hair?<\/em> Never<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Section three deals with daily life.<\/p>\n<p><em>How often did you receive a change of clothes (approximate date received)?<\/em> The prisoner clothes were never changed.<\/p>\n<p><em>What was exchanged?<\/em> Shirt and underpants were changed every third week.<\/p>\n<p><em>Was there any opportunity to wash or receive washed clothing?<\/em> No<\/p>\n<p><em>What kind of shoes?<\/em> Wooden shoes (clogs)<\/p>\n<p><em>Condition of the shoes?<\/em> bad<\/p>\n<p><em>List your other personal belongings (toothbrush, soap, tissue, toilet paper, etc, and how long you had them)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>How many roll calls were there per day?<\/em> about 4-5<\/p>\n<p><em>When?<\/em> Mornings, evenings, middle of the night<\/p>\n<p><em>How long did they normally last?<\/em> from 1 to 3 hours<\/p>\n<p><em>How long did the longest last?<\/em> 3 hours<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There is much more to be found in the document. It will be available in the document repository I am building with Omeka, where it can be translated and transcribed by anyone who wants.<\/p>\n<p>Much about the camp life is known because of memoirs of the Danish political prisoners.

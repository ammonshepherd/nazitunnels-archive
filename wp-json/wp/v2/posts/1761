I decided to look for eight specific &#8220;locations&#8221; and map those on a map of the camp. My goal is to see if where these events happen influence why they happen. Or if there is any correlation or outliers after mapping the data.<\/p>\n<p>I had a neat idea while reading one book: visualize what people knew geographically during a certain time. So the map represents the lands and info that a person\/people knew about. Say a person from 1820&#8217;s England. Their &#8220;map&#8221; of the world would include Europe, eastern US, maybe a few other countries, but exclude Antarctica?, Irabian peninsula?, Madagascar?, Thailand?, India?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have been reading up on Geographical Information Systems\/Sciences.

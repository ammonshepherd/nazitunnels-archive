The best find so far was the map showing the path of the 5th Armored Division as they swept through Germany.<\/p>\n<p>I was hoping to get information about the discovery of the underground factories, but the detail, so far, has been at a much higher level&#8230; this company moved here at this hour, and this company here, etc.<\/p>\n<p>It was interesting to mentally plot the course of these military groups as they approached and left the area I was interested in. For the most part, I could just type the town&#8217;s name into Google Maps to pull up the location, but I noticed what seemed like coordinates listed sometimes as well.<\/p>\n<p>That got me curious to see if there was a way to locate these coordinate points. I searched Google for &#8220;ww2 german map coordinates&#8221; which led me to <a href=\"http:\/\/forum.axishistory.com\/viewtopic.php?t=158724\">this post<\/a>\u00a0(http:\/\/forum.axishistory.com\/viewtopic.php?t=158724) at the the forums at axishistory.com, which led me to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.echodelta.net\/mbs\/eng-welcome.php\">this site<\/a>\u00a0(http:\/\/www.echodelta.net\/mbs\/eng-welcome.php) that converts old ww2 coordinates to locations in Google Maps.<\/p>\n<p>The system in use at the time uses a grid over northern Europe with a letter pair to distinguish each grid square. Within that square, a set of numbers determine the kilometers on the x and y axis to travel to reach the correct point. I had to guess which grid was used, since the coordinates were just numbers. It worked out well.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was looking through some after action reports from the U.S. military groups that entered the Minden, Porta Westfalica area in early April 1945.
